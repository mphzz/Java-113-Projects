## HW #4 for CS113 - Double Linked List Implementation

#### "A list is only as strong as its weakest link." — Donald Knuth
#### "If you find that you're spending almost all your time on theory, start turning some attention to practical things; it will improve your theories.

Provide your implementation for a DoubleLinkedList<E>. Apart from a default constructor and toString() method, make sure to implement the methods from the List interface and create an inner class implementing ListIterator interface (in addition to the necessary static inner class Node<E>). You will be graded on having all the methods below implemented and passing all JUnit tests for the List interface in addition to the JUnit tests for its ListIterator. Feel free to use code from the book (KWLinkedList) or slides.
  
  ListIterator interface methods to implement:
  
- Iterator<E> ||	iterator()
Returns an iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence.
